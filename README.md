# NumPy Quick-Revision 

This is a collection of my personal notes and examples while learning NumPy, the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

## What is NumPy? 🐍

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It's the foundation for data science and machine learning in Python!

## What's Included? 📋

These notes cover:

- Basic NumPy array creation and manipulation
- Array types, dimensions, and shapes
- Indexing and slicing operations
- Mathematical operations and statistics
- Broadcasting and vectorized operations
- Boolean arrays and conditional operations
- Linear algebra operations
- Utility functions (random number generation, reshaping, etc.)

## How to Use These Notes 📝

These notes are meant to be a quick reference guide. Each section includes code examples that you can run to see NumPy in action. Feel free to clone this repository and experiment with the examples!

```python
# Example: Creating arrays and performing operations
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Perform operations
print(arr * 2)  # [2 4 6 8 10]
print(arr.mean())  # 3.0
```

## Installation 💻

To use NumPy, you need to install it first:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

or with conda:

```bash
conda install numpy
```
